---

As most of you probably know Fates List was recently taken over by Lunar Development.
with this change came a lot of uncertainties about the status of our agreement 
with Fates List as a whole. Im sure you also have a ton of questions that i will try to answer!

## Does this effect Metro Reviews?
Simply put as of now it doesn't though Fates List was originally a founding list metro has always
and will always be internally owned, hosted and operated by [Infinity Development](https://infinitydev.team/). There will be no
effects as a result of this decission.

## Why the Support Drop?
Here at Metro we strongly stand behind all Bot List Community's however there are a number of actions
and events that can lead up to us dropping support for or blacklisting any community we choose at any time
without further written notice to protect ourselves and our users.

---

## What is the Next Steps?
There are a variety of updates and changes that need to be made to our website to accomidate the lose of support
and we will do our best to get it done as quickly as possible.
