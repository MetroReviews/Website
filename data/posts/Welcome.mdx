### What is Metro Reviews?
Metro Reviews is a simple service available to all Discord Bot Lists and Bot List Owners.

### Our Mission
We aim to simplify the way you manage your Bot Submissions and Reviews. Are you tired of those pesky users who
like to scrape bot list data? We are too so we came up with a way to handling cross adding bots and
managing your bot review system all in one place. No need to scrape data you can just send it to all
our supported lists if the bot owner chooses for it to be cross added
